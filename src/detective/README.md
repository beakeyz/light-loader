# Detective
Detective is a module in the lightloader that is supposed to find out all sorts of things about the machine we booted on. It is designed to dive deep into the nittygritty of the system and tell us which steps to take in order to boot correctly.

As of now, Detective is only a concept, but just as the scripts, it will be defined better in the future.
